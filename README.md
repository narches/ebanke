The development of the eBanke, a core banking application software involved the use of C#, ensuring a seamless and efficient creation process.
Here's a brief overview of the primary tool employed in crafting this sophisticated financial tool:

##### CSHARP (C#):

C# (C-Sharp) is a programming language developed by Microsoft that runs on the .NET Framework
It is used to develop web apps, desktop apps and mobile apps, games and much more.
It's fundamentally object-oriented and component-focused, supporting the creation and utilization of software components seamlessly.
Offering features like garbage collection, nullable types, robust exception handling,
lambda expressions, LINQ, asynchronous operations, a unified type system, and both reference and value types,
C# promotes consistent operations across types. Moreover, it supports generic methods, iterators,
and emphasizes versioning for evolution while ensuring compatibility, seen in aspects like separate virtual
and override modifiers, method overload resolution rules, and explicit interface member declarations.
